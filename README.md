# Object-Detection-Yolov3-TrafficManagement
This project is used for traffic management using object detection
1) The YOLO-V3 architecture is used for this project, with a few changes that I made. It is runnning on the Darknet Architecture. https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/ visit this site for more
2) I used my own weights model, and test clips for the project
3) The code detects and counts cars in a traffic lane, and based on the number of cars, decides whether the signal timings using a basic mathematical equation.
4) I applied my concepts of Convulational Nueral Networks to implement this model in the project
5) It successfully performed on a random traffic camera surveillance footage, giving 36 fps during detection phase on an intel i5, Nvidia GTX 1690
